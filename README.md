# QR-Code-Challenge!

The only thing throwing me for a loop as of now is the font family.  I've used the family giving in the style guide, but it doesn't seem to be the correct one. 
Any help regarding which font family to actually use would be appreciated!

Anything commented out is just me leaving unnecessary code I wrote. I tried to demonstrate my thinking and how it changed to be more efficient as I worked through the project.  Feel free to let me know if I should comment anything else out, haha.
